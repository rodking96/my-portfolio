Portfolio

My portfolio showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 
This portfolio highlights my strongest work/projects as well as the thought processes behind it.
All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
